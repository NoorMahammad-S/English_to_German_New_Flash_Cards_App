# New Flash Card App

Welcome to the Flash Card Program repository! This program is designed to help you learn and memorize new words and their translations.
It uses a graphical user interface built with Tkinter in Python.

This is a simple Python application for learning English to German flashcards. It provides a graphical user interface for users to flip through flashcards
and mark their knowledge of the translations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Flash Card Program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3 (with pip)
- Tkinter (which comes with most Python installations)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library

You can install Pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoorMahammad-S//flash-card-program.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd New_Flash_Cards_App
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python New_Flash_Cards_App.py
```

## Usage

- When you run the program, it will display flashcards with German words on one side and their English translations on the other side.
- Click the "Right" button if you know the translation, and the word will be marked as learned.
- Click the "Wrong" button if you don't know the translation, and the word will be shown again later.

## Customization

You can customize the program by providing your own word data. Simply replace the `german_words.csv` file in the `data` folder with your own data. 
The data should have columns for "German" and "English" words.
